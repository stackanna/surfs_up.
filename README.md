# Overview

W. Avy hired us to unveal temperature trends before opening the surf shop In Oahu Hawaii. In specific he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December
Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis (README.md)

Using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, youâ€™ll filter the date column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of June. Our goal is to convert those temperatures to a list, create a DataFrame from the list, and generate the summary statistics.

# Resources & Data systems used: Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy. 

# Overview of Analysis:

We filtered the date column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of December. We converted those temperatures to a list, created a DataFrame from the list, and generated the summary statistics for the first part of our mission.


# Results

- Our findings showed that there was a minimal difference in temperatures between the months of June & December. Varying slightly at a mean temperature of three degrees. 


The analysis should contain the following:

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
