# surfs_up.

W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.
This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report. You will submit the following:

Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December
Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis (README.md)

Using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, you’ll filter the date column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of June. You’ll then convert those temperatures to a list, create a DataFrame from the list, and generate the summary statistics.

Using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, you’ll filter the date column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of December. You’ll then convert those temperatures to a list, create a DataFrame from the list, and generate the summary statistics.
Follow the instructions below to complete Deliverable 2.

Use the instructions below to add code where indicated by the numbered comments in your SurfsUp_Challenge.ipynb file.
In Step 6, write a query that filters the date column from the Measurement table to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of December.
In Step 7, convert the December temperatures to a list.
In Step 8, create a DataFrame from the list of temperatures for the month of December.
In Step 9, generate the summary statistics for the December temperatures DataFrame.
After you run Step 9 in your SurfsUp_Challenge.ipynb file, confirm that the summary statistics match the image below.
You will earn a perfect score for Deliverable 2 by completing all requirements below:

A working query is written to retrieve the December temperatures from the date column of the Measurement table (10 pt)
The temperatures are added to a list. (10 pt)
​The list of temperatures is converted to a Pandas DataFrame. (10 pt)
Summary statistics are generated for the DataFrame. (10 pt)
For this part of the Challenge, write a report that describes the key differences in weather between June and December and two recommendations for further analysis.

The analysis should contain the following:

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
