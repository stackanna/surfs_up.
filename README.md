W. Avy hired us to unveal temperature trends before opening the surf shop In Oahu Hawaii. In specific he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

# Resources & Data systems used: Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy. 

# Overview of Analysis:

We filtered the date column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of December. We converted those temperatures to a list, created a DataFrame from the list, and generated the summary statistics for the first part of our mission.

# Results

- Our findings showed that there was a minimal difference in temperatures between the months of June & December. Varying slightly at a mean temperature of three degrees. That shouldnt impact the difference of ice cream sales significantly in the month of December, especially compared to many other areas of the world in the winter time.
